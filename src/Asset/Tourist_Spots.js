        description: "George Town is renowned for its vibrant street art, with visitors often discovering impressive murals as they explore the town. This artistic movement began in 2012 with six large murals painted by a Lithuanian artist, and has since blossomed into one of the city's key attractions. A popular spot for photos is the \"children on a bicycle\" mural. The streets of Muntri and Ah Quee are particularly famous for their murals, including the iconic 20-foot-high \"Little Girl in Blue\ and \"Boy on a Bike,\" which cleverly incorporates a real motorcycle into the artwork.",
